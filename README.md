# Fraud-Detection-in-Financial-Transactions
## 1- Machine Learning Engineer SHR1_AIS5_S1e

## Project Plan :

Week 1: Data Collection and Preprocessing :-

* Data Collection: Obtain financial transaction data, including labeled fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.
* Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, addressing missingvalues and normalizing features.

Tasks :

* Tools: Python (Pandas, NumPy).

• Deliverables:
o Cleaned and preprocessed dataset.
o Data preprocessing notebook.


Week 2: Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning :-

* Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical analysis to understand thedistribution of fraud-related features.
* Machine Learning: Develop and evaluate classification models for frauddetection (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

Tasks :

* Tools: Python (Scikit-learn, Statsmodels).

• Deliverables:
o Statistical analysis report.
o Fraud detection models and performance metrics.


Week 3: Advanced Techniques :-

* NLP for Transaction Notes: Apply NLP techniques to analyze transaction descriptions or notes.


Tasks :

Tools: Python (NLTK, SpaCy).

• Deliverables:
o Enhanced fraud detection model with NLP integration.

Week 4: MLOps, GANs, and Final Presentation :-

Tasks :

* MLOps: Use MLflow to manage and track fraud detection models.
* GANs for Synthetic Data: Implement a GAN to generate synthetic fraud transaction data for training and validation.
* Final Report and Presentation: Document the project including data analysis, model development, and deployment.

Tools: MLflow, Python (TensorFlow/PyTorch for GANs).

• Deliverables:
o Deployed fraud detection model with synthetic data.
o Final report and presentation.
